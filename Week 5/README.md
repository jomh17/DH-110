# Low Fidelity Prototype

### Josephine Meyer-Hogan


## Overview

**Purpose:** The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to verify whether or not the features that I have created are things a user is looking for an making sure the flow of the site/app is intitutive. This will alert the UX team if there are intermediate steps that need to be added, clearer instructions, etc.


Below are the three features I wanted to integrate into my app. 

### Key features of design:
1) allowing the user to compare prices from websites they choose and finding experiences within their budget
2) allowing the trip details to be shared with others and automatically filled in
3) connects with your calendar so you can figure out available dates

Additional information for the personas I created is below.

### Task 1: (this is the pink line on the wireframe)
Login to the website as an existing user, use your calendar availability to book a flight and then  share the trip with your friends.

### Task 2: (this is the blue line on the wireframe) 
Login to the website as an existing user, fill out a profile, find a hotel, using saved info. After find a rental car.

Here is a link to the wireframing of both tasks! [Linked] [here]()

Feedback Task 1:

I realized as the user was going through the task that I needed a different share page than the existing one. I had share trip before the user booked on the external site. To fix this problem, I would have to make a way for the user to get back to the home page after leaving the site. I did not specify that in the wireframe. 
Another thing I found was that some features were unnecessary. For example, the checking bags options does not need ot be on the site, the user is able to do that straight from the airline website and skip a step by coming onto the site.

Feedback Task 2:

Similar to task 1, I did not provide steps to get back to the home page after going onto the hotel & car pages. I also was thinking of features when I was writing the wireframe as they came to me, so that did not exactly make the frame that easy to follow. 
So some of the pages should have been differently placed. I feel like if it was an actual app, I would know how everything is set up, but because it is only a paper model, there are things that I did not realize I needed to specify.
