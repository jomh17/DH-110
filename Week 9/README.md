## 1)Travel Buddy- Josephine Meyer-Hogan
</br>
### 2) Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
I am hoping to create a travel app called Travel Buddy that makes it easy to share trips and coordinate with your friends. I want this app to have flights, hotels, experiences, etc so a user only has to use my app to book a trip. I also want to put an emphasis on feedback after a trip is completed. This would allow other users to view experiences and book their trip accordingly. The goal of the app is to make travel as easy as possible, even allowing you to sync your calendar, compare with your friends, and easily find availability.
</br>
### 3) Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
Key features of design:
allowing the user to compare prices from websites they choose and finding experiences within their budget
allowing the trip details to be shared with others and automatically filled in
connects with your calendar so you can figure out available dates

### 4) Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:

Project: I chose these two website, Handshake and Glassdoor, because I am a senior and am commonly using websites like these to look for potential employers. It is really important for these websites to follow all 10 heuristics to ensure that user's can reach out to companies and find jobs.

Handshake is a popular platform for students looking for internships, jobs, and connections. The purpose of Handshake is so that its community of alumni can help others find opportunities.

We will be performing a usability test for Handshake. The purpose of a usability test is to identify and learn the weaknesses of a website through a thorough evaluation. A user's perspective allows for a fresh set of eyes looking at the site and illuminates flaws that would not be noticed otherwise. Usability test sessions are recorded so the information won't be misinterpreted, the user's expressions can be saved, and further analysis can be done. The tests consist of a series of questions and tasks that guide the user in interacting with the site and using specific functions. The user audibly describes their thoughts during the questioning, providing live feedback of the user's experience. After this information is collected, the site can be improved so that the future user experience is improved.

## 5) User research [contextual inquiry, assignment03]:
Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
What is the basic need involved for that activity?
What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Step 2: Identify target users
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Where would the users do that activity?
What would the users do to complete that activity?
Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
The observation methods I employed included participatory observation and recording. The interview took place over zoom and was recorded to view the facial expressions and thought process of the user throughout the interview.

## 6) UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment04]
The purpose of UX storytelling is to get in the mindset of the user to better understand them; it allows design teams to gain insights into their usersâ€™ thought process and think about how they would approach situations and what they are looking for. This adds additional information for the team such as a user's typical behaviors and actions. This also allows for better brainstorming of functionlities of a site. Defining the users of the site allows for a more specific and intentional design, when keeping the users in mind.

## 7) Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment05 + part of 06]
Purpose: The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to verify whether or not the features that I have created are things a user is looking for an making sure the flow of the site/app is intitutive. This will alert the UX team if there are intermediate steps that need to be added, clearer instructions, etc.

## 8) Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Prototyping is the logical flow from a low fidelity prototype and provides a more accurate and complete experience for the user. After completing a low fidelity prototype and verifing whether or not the features that I have created are things a user is looking for, I was able to make changes according to the user's feedback and making sure the flow of the site/app is intitutive. Creating a wireframe prototype allows a user to really get a feel for the app including the color scheme, logo, and overall aesthetic value. The user is then able to more accurately make their way through the site, with the wireframing that I wish to include. This is an interesting test to observe, because I am able to see where the user's idea of a flow of the website and my wireframe overlap. This feedback is incredibly helpful and can take your app from prototype to actuality.
