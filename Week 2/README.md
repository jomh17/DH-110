<h3> User testing </h3>
Handshake is a popular platform for students looking for internships, jobs, and connections. The purpose of Handshake is so that its community of alumni can help others find opportunities.    <br/> <br/>


We will be performing a usability test for Handshake. The purpose of a usability test is to identify and learn the weaknesses of a website through a thorough evaluation. A user's perspective allows for a fresh set of eyes looking at the site and illuminates flaws that would not be noticed otherwise. Usability test sessions are recorded so the information won't be misinterpreted, the user's expressions can be saved, and further analysis can be done. The tests consist of a series of questions and tasks that guide the user in interacting with the site and using specific functions. The user audibly describes their thoughts during the questioning, providing live feedback of the user's experience. After this information is collected, the site can be improved so that the future user experience is improved.


For Handshake, the usability issues I found from my heuristic reviews were as follows:

* Difficulties in filtering search results
* Different users have different search results
* The tabs were not consistent from the homepage to the additional sites

For my usability test, I performed it in my room using my personal MAC laptop. I used Zoom to facilitate and record the usability test. The session recorded the screen(the Handshake website), the user, and both of our audios. This usability test is a pilot test, and my friend was the user.

<h3> The process of the usability test was as follows: </h3>

* Intro
* Consent form
* Background questions
* Pre-test questions
* Tasks
* Post-test questionnaire
* Product satisfaction card
* Additional thoughts/comments 
* Demographics


<h3> The following results were measured (many using the seven-point Likert scale): </h3>

* Ease of use
* Site complexity
* Frequency of use
* Trustworthiness
* Mastery of site
* Consistency 
* Site organization
* Site content
* Site functions
* User confidence in the site

<h3> Improving user testing </h3>
During the pilot test, I learned what usability issues existed for Handshake. For example, prior to testing when I was planning tests, I found the Engineering Events very easily. I thought this would also be the case for the participant. I now believe that different users receive different search results based on the information in their profile. I think this should be changed immediately. There should be an option to filter results based on information but it should not be automatic. Another flaw is the inconsistency in the site's headings. The tabs on the homepage do not match with the tabs on subsequent pages which is very confusing for the user. The test went really well, the user felt comfortable on the call. In the future I would be more specific when asking questions because there was some sligt confusion. For example, I was talking about the overall tasks but the user thought I was mentioning the mini tasks. I would also ask feedback questions throughout the video so the user would be more specific about feedback.
