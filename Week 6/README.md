# Prototyping
Prototyping is the logical flow from a low fidelity prototype and provides a more accurate and complete experience for the user. After completing a low fidelity prototype and verifing whether or not the features that I have created are things a user is looking for, I was able to make changes according to the user's feedback and making sure the flow of the site/app is intitutive. Creating a wireframe prototype allows a user to really get a feel for the app including the color scheme, logo, and overall aesthetic value. The user is then able to more accurately make their way through the site, with the wireframing that I wish to include. This is an interesting test to observe, because I am able to see where the user's idea of a flow of the website and my wireframe overlap. This feedback is incredibly helpful and can take your app from prototype to actuality. 

## My project
I am hoping to create a travel app called Travel Buddy that makes it easy to share trips and coordinate with your friends. I want this app to have flights, hotels, experiences, etc so a user only has to use my app to book a trip. I also want to put an emphasis on feedback after a trip is completed. This would allow other users to view experiences and book their trip accordingly. The goal of the app is to make travel as easy as possible, even allowing you to sync your calendar, compare with your friends, and find availability. 

## Color Theory: 
I formed my color palette based on the colors in the logo. I liked the teal theme because it felt like tropical water, creating a feeling of a get-away or vacation that represents the site well. I wanted to keep a really cohesive color scheme but have enough contrast so that everything is easily readable. I chose a light background that's not white to add interest while making sure everything has high contrast. I tried to keep color-blind people in mind as I chose the scheme, so I kept everything within the same color family. Making it monochromatic keeps the site cohesive and aesthetic. On the pages that had multiple features, I alternated my colors so that each option is emphasized and it doesn't blend together too much. I added a semi-thick black border to outline each feature and differentiate between them. I used black font throughout the site so that everything was easibly readable. My focus was on readability and contrast while keeping a really aesthetic app. 

## Logo:
I wanted a simple and effective logo for my site. I found this logo and I thought it met those qualifications. The marker behind the words Travel Buddy is like a marker on a map, which really brings the travel element into the logo. The shape is very compelling, and there is good color contrast. I chose the name travel buddy, because it is cute, speaks to the purpose of the app, and is easy to understand when written/spoken. 

## Spacing:
I tried to choose sizing and spacing relative to the importance of the object. For example: on the opening home page, I made the logo fairly large to put more emphasis on it. Keeping the sign in and sign up smaller but also equally important. On the following pages, I made the logo smaller because the user is already in the site, so the headings then become more inmportant. On some of the pages, I struggled to try to include all the information I wanted, while still maintaining good symmetry and spacing on the site. I used the feedback from my wireframe accessability last week to really modify the content on each page. Condensing the important information was kind of hard, but the simpler the app, the more usable. I wanted to make the font as large as possible to accomodate for poeple who can't see well.

# Link to wireframe 
My wireframe is [linked] [here](https://framer.com/projects/Travel-Buddy--1FuYqU0xhOxqcMBpgSy8-eDOha).

## Capability
My focus of this wireframe was on the first pages of the site, home page, login, sign up, profile, etc. From the wireframe assignment last week, I learned that you need to be incredibly thorough, so I really wanted to make these beginning pages very intitutive and easy to understand. From the starting page, the user is able to sign in or sign up. If they click the sign in button, it then takes you to the home page. If the user clicks the sign up button, it takes them to a sign up page. After they finish signing up they then go to the home page as well. I also created the profile page. So on teh home page, if the user clicks the profile button, it will take them to that page. This was the main focus of my project thus far. Choosing what is on each page and editing down so that there is only the necessary information. Because this is an app and not a website, there is a limited amount of information that can fit onto an iPhone screen. This is an important aspect to take into account and may result in additional pages in the wireframe.
