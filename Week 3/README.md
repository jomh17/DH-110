<h3> <b> Step 1: Specify the main design challenge </b> </h3>
What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

This project will support users in being able to quickly and easily find recipes with ingriedients they already have at home

What is the basic need involved for that activity?

This activity fulfills the userâ€™s basic psysiological and esteem needs. They are able to satisify their need for hunger as well as feel a sense of accomplishment after finding and completing a recipe 

What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

Certain limitations for traveling and parking include not knowing availability ahead of time and as a result, spending a lot of time looking for parking or not heading out to a destination at all. Added functionality to the ParkMobile app could definitely help users discover places that they feel comfortable visiting due to positive parking situations and ensure that they become repeat visitors.

<h3> <b> Step 2: Identify target users </b> </h3>
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)

Demographic: people of all ages who are looking for recipe ideas, specifically young adults beginning to cook or busy users with a limited amount of time

Preferences: users have the desire and ability to search for food to make at home

Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

Where would the users do that activity?

There are two main activities that can be accomplished using the  

What would the users do to complete that activity?

To make their quick and easy recipe, users would first look up different things they would like to make, then choose a recipe that stood out to them. After deciding on a recipe, the user would need to read through it and ensure that they have all the necessary ingredients. After the necessary prep, the user would then follow the instructions in the recipe and begin to cook

<h3> <b> Step 3: Pick observation method(s)</b> </h3>

The observation methods I employed included participatory observation and recording. The interview took place over zoom and was recorded to view the facial expressions and thought process of the user throughout the interview.

<h3> <b> Reflection </b> </h3>
I really enjoyed this activity. The user had much more freedom than in our past tasks. This allowed me to observe their full thought process from start to finish, gaining more insight into the way a typical user would think. There were no preconceptions made by me because I had no clue what the user was going to do. This ensures that the interview has much less bias. The questions asked in this interview were also more specific and focused, engaging the user in a deeper way. I think it would be beneficial to do this interview multiple times to really get a grasp on the user's thought process. It would also be super cool to go through this type of interview to make sure we are covering all the bases when asking questions.
