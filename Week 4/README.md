### What is the purpose of UX storytelling?

The purpose of UX storytelling is to get in the mindset of the user to better understand them; it allows design teams to gain insights into their users’ thought process and think about how they would approach situations and what they are looking for.
This adds additional information for the team such as a user's typical behaviors and actions. This also allows for better brainstorming of functionlities of a site. Defining the users of the site allows for a more specific
and intentional design, when keeping the users in mind.

### Key features of design:
1) allowing the user to compare prices from websites they choose and finding experiences within their budget
2) allowing the trip details to be shared with others and automatically filled in
3) connects with your calendar so you can figure out available dates

### Brenda’s Scenario:

Why:
Brenda needs a break! She has been working at the office all day and been running around with the kids all night. 
The kids are out of school for the summer and she is trying to find a fun and enjoyable vacation for the entire family. 
She plans the trip every year and it’s really important to her that the whole family has a great time. 
With all this in mind, she is struggling to coordinate this trip with a work deadline coming up. 
She is too busy to do extensive research to figure out where to go, and whenever she tries to look at different destinations, something always comes up.

How:
Brenda first looks at her calendar to see when she would be able to take off work. She comes up with a few possible weeks over the 
summer where everyone is free. Then she searches some of her favorite travel blogs for inspiration of where the family should go. 
She searches a travel comparison site that offers deals so she can compare prices of different trips. This allowed her to find the 
cheapest option and bundle the hotel all at once. She was then able to be excited for the trip coming up.
