# Low Fidelity Prototype

### Josephine Meyer-Hogan


## Overview

**Purpose:** The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to verify whether or not the features that I have created are things a user is looking for an making sure the flow of the site/app is intitutive. This will alert the UX team if there are intermediate steps that need to be added, clearer instructions, etc.


Below are the three features I wanted to integrate into my app. 

### Key features of design:
1) allowing the user to compare prices from websites they choose and finding experiences within their budget
2) allowing the trip details to be shared with others and automatically filled in
3) connects with your calendar so you can figure out available dates

Additional information for the personas I created is below.

### Task 1: (this is the purple line on the wireframe)
Login to the website as an existing user, use your calendar availability to book a flight and then  share the trip with your friends.
I had the users do a practice run before drawing their final route onto the paper, so the paths would be more clear.


### Task 2: (this is the yellow line on the wireframe) 
Login to the website as an existing user, fill out a profile, find a hotel, using saved info. After find a rental car.
I had the users do a practice run before drawing their final route onto the paper, so the paths would be more clear.

Here is a link to the wireframing of both tasks! [Linked] [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvED88dYVO7PFMnsnklRGBPLcOZqoNA1vzkdwAJWKV0/edit?usp=sharing)

Feedback Task 1:

I realized as the user was going through the task that I needed a different share page than the existing one. I had share trip before the user booked on the external site. To fix this problem, I would have to make a way for the user to get back to the home page after leaving the site. I did not specify that in the wireframe. Another thing I found was that some features were unnecessary. For example, the checking bags options does not need ot be on the site, the user is able to do that straight from the airline website and skip a step by coming onto the site.


Feedback Task 2:

Similar to task 1, I did not provide steps to get back to the home page after going onto the hotel & car pages. I also was thinking of features when I was writing the wireframe as they came to me, so that did not exactly make the frame that easy to follow. So some of the pages should have been differently placed when asking a user to complete the tasks. I feel like if it was an actual app, I would know how everything is set up, but because it is only a paper model, there are things that I did not realize I needed to specify. 


Comments from the user:
The order the pages were in was not very clear to me. It took me a minute to figure out where the next screens were located. I was confused if some of the pages for booking were on external sites or if they were on the app itself. The back button was confusing because it wasn't actually written out. Other than that, I thought that you have a lot of really good pages on the frame. 

Conclusion:
I will definitely make everything much clearer when creating my next wireframe prototype. I think more self trials were needed before I got the user involved. I told the user that the back button was just linked on the screen, so they could go back at any time, but I think that was hard to follow. The next time I do a wireframe, I would have this information printed onto the papers. In my app, I was planning on having the icons be able to take the user back, like I have seen in many apps. I was really focused on trying to include all the pages I would need, that I didn't really focus on the design specfics. I would change this if I were to do it again.
