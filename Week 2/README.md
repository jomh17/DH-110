<h3> User testing </h3>
Handshake is a popular platform for students looking for internships, jobs, and connections. The purpose of Handshake is so that its community of alumni can help others find opportunities.

We will be performing a usability test for Handshake. 
***The purpose of usability tests is to evaluate a site's interface and notice flaws in its usability. Usability tests intend to improve a site from a user's perspective. Usability test sessions are recorded for analysis of user behavior and potential areas for improvement. In the tests, users are asked to complete a short series of tasks and describe their process of completing said tasks.

For Handshake, the usability issues I found from my heuristic reviews were as follows:

* Difficulties in filtering search results
* Different users have different search results
* The tabs were not consistent from the homepage to the additional sites

For my usability test, I performed it in my room using my personal MAC laptop. I used Zoom to facilitate and record the usability test. The session recorded the screen(the Handshake website), the user, and both of our audios. This usability test is a pilot test, and my friend was the user.

<h3> The process of the usability test was as follows: </h3>

* Intro
* Consent form
* Background questions
* Previous experience questions
* Pre-test questions
* Tasks
* Post-test questions
* SUS questionnaire
* Product satisfaction card
* Additional comments 
* Demographics


<h3> The following results were measured (many using the seven-point Likert scale): </h3>

* Ease of use
* Frequency of use
* Learn ability
* Trustworthiness
* Site organization
* Site content
* How the user felt after using site

<h3> Improving user testing </h3>
During the pilot test, I learned what usability issues existed for Handshake. For example, prior to testing when I was planning tests, I found the Engineering Events very easily. I thought this would also be the case for the participant. I now believe that different users receive different search results based on the information in their profile. I think this should be changed immediately. There should be an option to filter results based on information but it should not be automatic. Another flaw is the inconsistency in the site's headings. The tabs on the homepage do not match with the tabs on subsequent pages which is very confusing for the user.
