# Assignment 1: Heuristic evaluation
## DH110, Josephine Meyer-Hogan

*Project:* I chose these two website, Handshake and Glassdoor, because I am a senior and am commonly using websites like these to look for potential employers. It is really important for these websites to follow all 10 heuristics to ensure that user's can reach out to companies and find jobs.

## Website 1: Handshake

Handshake is a website where students and recent graduates can look at companies who are hiring. You can discover jobs and internships, directly message with employers, and connect with alumni and current employees. There are also student reviews of employers, links to virtual events, and applications you can fill out directly on the site. 

| Heuristics Description | Evaluation  | Improvements  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------|
|**1. Visibility of system status:** The user receives feedback from actions taken on the website promptly.| **Good:** The site loads fairly quickly when switching between pages, and a spinning circle shows that the site is being loaded. When hovering over words, they become underlined to show the user where they are on the page. The bottom of the jobs page has a page number at the bottom of the search. |**Improvements:** The line under words during hovering could be replaced by highlighting the words so it becomes more clear. The underline is somewhat far from the word so it may not be immediately clear.(Level 1 priority) The page number should also be at the top of the searches so that it is more easily seen.(Level 2 priority)|
|**2. Match between system and real world:** Phrases and concepts on the site should be easily understood by the user. Information on the site should proceed in a logical order.|**Good:** The site bases the pages off of the user profile inlcuding their major so all the words should be understood by the user. Many headings include short explanations below them for further clarification. **Bad:** The homepage does not present the information in the most clear and natural way. There is a mix of information that causes it to be slightly confusing. On the jobs page there are immediately results without searching that can be very overwhelming.|**Improvements:** Allow for the flow of the page to be more natural, clarify the headings and information on the homepage. On the jobs page, allow for the user to search before offering results.(Level 1 priority)|
|**3. User control and freedom:** The user has the ability to opt out or exit in the case they make a mistake or get confused.| **Good:** The user is able to go back to the homepage at any point when using the site. **Bad:** The home button is an icon that is not necessarily very clear, there is no "back" button.|**Improvements:** Add a homepage button that is clearly labeled, add a back button at the top of the search. (Level 3 priority)|
|**4. Consistency and standards:** The website is standardized in language and design across all pages.| **Bad:** Every page looks different. The homepage is navy with white writing, every other page is white with black writing. Each page: jobs, students, events has a different layout. In jobs the search is at top, but in students, the search is on the side. The search filters are not the same, buttons boxes etc.|**Improvements:** Standardize the look across all pages on the site. Alter the search and filters so that they resemble all the others. (Level 2 priority)|
|**5. Error Prevention:** Ensure that any common errors can be avoided. In addition, providing the user with pop-ups to make sure that the user is aware of all of their actions, such as confirmation messages.|**Good:** There are save functions so the user can save events and jobs to compile and look at later. **Bad:** The saved events cannot be easily found. There are no popups with warnings or confirmations.|**Improvements:** Make saved jobs and events into a new tab instead of being hard to find. (Level 2. priority)|
|**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Provide all the necessary information in a clear manner so the user does not have to search for the information they need.|**Good:** There are many filters that allow the user to easily see considerations without having to search. There are also sorting functions so that you can view results by relevance, date posted, etc. Each posting has details under it so the user does not need to do additional research. Many headings include short explanations below them for further clarification.|**Improvements:** The site has met this requirement (No priority).|
|**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Provide shortcuts to make the user's experience more streamlined. This may also include customization or personalization based on the user's preferences.|The first step on the site is to sign into a profile. This tailors the information on the site to the individual user. Most of the jobs, events, students, etc has already gone through initial sorting as a shortcut for the user.|**Improvements:** The discover page is not filtered at all and includes irrelevant postings. This should be rectified to include more pertinent listings.(Level 2 priority)|
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Make sure that the website is clear, readable, and aesthetically pleasing. Eliminate any unnecessary or irrelevant information that clutters the page.|**Good:** The homepage has large font and the message is clear.**Bad:** When scrollng down the homepage, the information provides should be in other tabs, there is too much information on the first page. All other tabs have a lack of aesthetic and color. |**Improvements:** The homepage is way too cluttered and should be simplified. Additional tabs should include more color and design to make it more aesthetic. (Level 2 priority) |
|**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Any error message should express the problem and how to fix it in clear language.|**Good:** Under the profile button, there is a help tab that includes instructions on how to recover from errors they may encounter|**Improvements:** This location should be more clear and listed on the homepage.

Glassdoor is a competing website where current and former employees rate companies and submit salaries anonymously. It also caters to users seeking to apply for open job listings. This allows users to see what working at a company would be like and seeing if they fit in the atmosphere before applying.
