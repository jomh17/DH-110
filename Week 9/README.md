# 1)Travel Buddy- Josephine Meyer-Hogan


## 2) Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
I am hoping to create a travel app called Travel Buddy that makes it easy to share trips and coordinate with your friends. I want this app to have flights, hotels, experiences, etc so a user only has to use my app to book a trip. I also want to put an emphasis on feedback after a trip is completed. This would allow other users to view experiences and book their trip accordingly. A super important feature I want to highlight is being able to share and message your friends within the app. It is so hard to coordinate trips with your friends, and that's where Travel Buddy comes in. Being able to share trips, message, and compare calendars with your friends allows your trips to be seamless! The goal of the app is to make travel as easy as possible, even allowing you to sync your calendar, compare with your friends, and easily find travel availability.



## 3) Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
One of the main issues my app is trying to fix, is the difficulty planning trips with other people. It is very hard to coordinate scheduling flights, hotels, cars, etc. To address this, I wanted to provide the user with quick and easy conveinence when planning a trip. The app is oriented with an emphasis on sharing, messaging, and conveience of travel planning. There are 4 key features I wanted to include that are listed below. 

Key features of design:
1. allowing the user to compare prices from websites they choose and finding experiences within their budget
2. allowing the trip details to be shared with others and automatically filled in
3. connects with your calendar so you can figure out available dates
4. link calendar with friends for ease of planning



## 4) User research 
Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
What is the basic need involved for that activity?
What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Step 2: Identify target users
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Where would the users do that activity?
What would the users do to complete that activity?
Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
The observation methods I employed included participatory observation and recording. The interview took place over zoom and was recorded to view the facial expressions and thought process of the user throughout the interview.
The methods I used to interview my user is linked [here](https://github.com/jomh17/DH-110/tree/main/Week%203)



## 5) UX storytelling 
The purpose of UX storytelling is to get in the mindset of the user to better understand them; it allows design teams to gain insights into their usersâ€™ thought process and think about how they would approach situations and what they are looking for. This adds additional information for the team such as a user's typical behaviors and actions. This also allows for better brainstorming of functionlities of a site. Defining the users of the site allows for a more specific and intentional design, when keeping the users in mind.
More information about user persona's and profiles is linked [here](https://github.com/jomh17/DH-110/tree/main/Week%204)


## 6) Wireframe and graphic design element variation 
Purpose: The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to verify whether or not the features that I have created are things a user is looking for an making sure the flow of the site/app is intitutive. This will alert the UX team if there are intermediate steps that need to be added, clearer instructions, etc.

## 7) Low-fidelity prototype 
Prototyping is the logical flow from a low fidelity prototype and provides a more accurate and complete experience for the user. After completing a low fidelity prototype and verifing whether or not the features that I have created are things a user is looking for, I was able to make changes according to the user's feedback and making sure the flow of the site/app is intitutive. Creating a wireframe prototype allows a user to really get a feel for the app including the color scheme, logo, and overall aesthetic value. The user is then able to more accurately make their way through the site, with the wireframing that I wish to include. This is an interesting test to observe, because I am able to see where the user's idea of a flow of the website and my wireframe overlap. This feedback is incredibly helpful and can take your app from prototype to actuality.

## 8) High-fidelity prototype
This was a really big step in the development process. Being able to change from a paper wireframe to a fully functional prototype was a very exciting process. Fleshing out exactly what I wanted my site to look like took a lot of time and energy to fully develop. It is a pretty tedious process that involves a lot fo factors, such as user input, color theory, etc. I hope you enjoy what I have created so far.

## 10) Conclusion: what you learned throughout the process
I learned a lot throughout this process, especially through the final assignment. I had to take the recording a few times, because there were things I missed or functions that worked incorrectly. Creating a pitch and walking someone through the site is a true test to whether or not you and your site are ready. This has been a really cool experience to be able to start from an idea and graduate to a complete app. There is a lot more that goes into app development than I thought at the start of the class. I was able to see a lot of different perspectives, of multiple users, my classmates, heuristic evaluation, etc. This has allowed me to create a comprehensive app. I would not have been successful, if we just jumped right to this step, the intermediate testing was definitely necessary. This task inherently has a lot of freedom, so it was really cool to see where everyone went with the app in mind. In the future, I am looking to continue to develop and make the app more complex.
