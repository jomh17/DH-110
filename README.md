# Assignment 1: Heuristic evaluation
## DH110, Josephine Meyer-Hogan

*Project:* I chose these two website, Handshake and Glassdoor, because I am a senior and am commonly using websites like these to look for potential employers. It is really important for these websites to follow all 10 heuristics to ensure that user's can reach out to companies and find jobs.

## Website 1: Handshake

Link: https://joinhandshake.com/

Handshake is a website where students and recent graduates can look at companies who are hiring. You can discover jobs and internships, directly message with employers, and connect with alumni and current employees. There are also student reviews of employers, links to virtual events, and applications you can fill out directly on the site. 

| Heuristics Description | Evaluation  | Improvements  |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------|
|**1. Visibility of system status:** The user receives feedback from actions taken on the website promptly.| **Good:** The site loads fairly quickly when switching between pages, and a spinning circle shows that the site is being loaded. When hovering over words, they become underlined to show the user where they are on the page. The bottom of the jobs page has a page number at the bottom of the search. |**Improvements:** The line under words during hovering could be replaced by highlighting the words so it becomes more clear. The underline is somewhat far from the word so it may not be immediately clear. The page number should also be at the top of the searches so that it is more easily seen |
|**2. Match between system and real world:** Phrases and concepts on the site should be easily understood by the user. Information on the site should proceed in a logical order.|**Good:** |**Improvements:** |
|**3. User control and freedom:** The user has the ability to opt out or exit in the case they make a mistake or get confused.||**Improvements:** |
|**4. Consistency and standards:** The website is standardized in language and design across all pages.||**Improvements:** |
|**5. Error Prevention:** Ensure that any common errors can be avoided. In addition, providing the user with pop-ups to make sure that the user is aware of all of their actions, such as confirmation messages.||**Improvements:** |
|**6. Recognition rather than recall:** Provide all the necessary information in a clear manner so the user does not have to search for the information they need.||**Improvements:** |
|**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Provide shortcuts to make the user's experience more streamlined. This may also include customization or personalization based on the user's preferences.||**Improvements:** |
|**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:** Make sure that the website is clear, readable, and aesthetically pleasing. Eliminate any unnecessary or irrelevant information that clutters the page.||**Improvements:** |
|**9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:** Any error message should express the problem and how to fix it in clear language.||**Improvements:** |
|**10. Help and documentation:** Provide easy to locate documentation to help with commonly asked questions and allow the user to quickly find answers.||**Improvements:** |

## Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation 
|Rating|      Importance| 
|----|------|
|1|Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
|2| Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
|3| Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority|
